Subject: ip link: Remove unnecessary device checking

The real checking is performed later in iplink_modify(..) func which
checks device existence if NLM_F_CREATE flag is set.

Also it fixes the case when impossible to add veth link which was
caused by 9a02651a87 (ip: check for missing dev arg when doing VF rate)
because these devices are not exist yet.
